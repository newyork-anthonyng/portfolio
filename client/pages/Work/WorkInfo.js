      When I was a student in General Assembly,
      I was surrounded by amazing instructors that inspired and pushed me to be better.
      I wanted to do what they did and became a mentor for General Assembly's JavaScript Circuit course;
      which covers basic JavaScript, DOM manipulation, jQuery and external API's.
      I do 1-on-1 video sessions with students and answer any questions they have and provide project feedback.

      At Refundo, I worked on their income tax preparation software named RushTax.
      I designed and developed front-end features using AngularJS and jQuery.
      Later on, I learned PHP and worked on back-end APIs which handled sensitive client information,
      file uploads and user account CRUD operations. With an eye towards best practices,
      I created API documentation and set up front-end unit tests using Karma and Jasmine.
