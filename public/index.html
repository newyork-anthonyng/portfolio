				<span class="company">General Assembly</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						When I was a student in General Assembly, I was surrounded by amazing instructors that inspired and pushed me to be better.
						I wanted to do what they did and became a mentor for General Assembly's JavaScript Circuit course; which covers basic JavaScript,
						DOM manipulation, jQuery and external API's. I do 1-on-1 video sessions with students and answer any questions they have and
						provide project feedback.

				<span class="company">Free Code Camp</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						I have a passion for learning, and I believe writing and teaching others is one of the best ways to cement what you've learned.
						I have started writing and submitting articles to Free Code Camp's Medium publication, including:
						<ol>
							<li>Let’s test React components with TDD, Mocha, Chai, and jsdom</li>
							<li>Mistakes people make with their &lt;img&gt;’s</li>
						</ol>

				<span class="company">Refundo</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						At Refundo, I worked on their income tax preparation software named RushTax. I designed and developed front-end features
						using AngularJS and jQuery. Later on, I learned PHP and worked on back-end APIs which handled sensitive client information,
						file uploads and user account CRUD operations. With an eye towards best practices, I created API documentation and set up
						front-end unit tests using Karma and Jasmine.
					</p>

				<span class="company">Geeks Rule</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						GeeksRule is a nonprofit organization focused on promoting STEM among underserved youth. I volunteered to provide a makeover
						to their website, with a focus on making it responsive and performant.

				<span class="date">10/15 - 12/15</span>
				<span class="company">General Assembly</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						I completed General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program, a 12 week course where I acquired the skills to build
						real websites. I learned Ruby on Rails and the MEAN stack. Some notable projects I worked on was: a to-do list website built
						with Rails designed to focus on work-life balance, which won first place in Programmr.com's Anthology Work-Life Balance
						contest; a website that shows you a list of nearby stores and attractions using Geolocation and Google Map's API.

				<span class="date">08/16 - 09/16</span>
				<span class="company">Project: YouTube Repeat</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						I love listening to songs on repeat. With this hobby project, I created a web app that will play a YouTube video and loop it.
						I wanted to learn about CI and implemented Jenkins into my build process, with Istanbul/NYC for test coverage, and Mocha for
						the testing framework. I used React, and Redux with Thunk to create the front-end, along with the YouTube Player API and
						YouTube Data API.

				<span class="date">07/16 - 08/16</span>
				<span class="company">Project: Pomodoro Timer</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						I use the pomodoro technique as my time management tool. With this hobby project, I created a Pomodoro Timer using React and
						Redux, and learned about Web Workers to get the timer to work even when the webpage is inactive.
					</p>

			<li>
				<span class="date">08/16 - 08/16</span>
				<span class="company">Talk: Vim Talk</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						As a newly converted Vim user, I gave a talk at General Assembly about the power of Vim, including navigation, macros and
						common workflow patterns. Most importantly, people learned how to safely exit the Vim editor.
